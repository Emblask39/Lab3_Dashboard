## Using Guide 

Through Python in Analitics.ipynb I realize ETL process; inside the file there's not only the scrypt to process, save and create Wordclouds; but also it's commented via Markdown each part of the process.

After saving all 3 files "aircrafts.csv", "airlines.csv", "crashes.csv" inside the folder "TransformedCSV" I load all the data into MySQL database "database_crashes.sql".

Finally Export that database to PowerBI and Analize it to create a good dashboard ready to be presente to the public in file "Dashboard.pbix". it cointains multiple pages eachone with buttons to navigate through them, as well as some graphics that change parameters to show another type of data via other buttons 
## Roadmap

- Improve the quality of pre-proccessing
- Create the file in a separate enviroment to easily execute it 
- Use of natural language proccessing to collect a lot of data saved in "summary" column
- try new algorithm models more responsive to the type of data
- Getting a precise requirement from the "recruiter", it can be better shown in the dashboard exactly the info needed
